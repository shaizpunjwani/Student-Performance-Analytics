# Student-Performance-Analytics

This dataset is taken from kaggle where we are analyzing the student performance based on some features and we try to determine the writing marks of the student.

First we tried to analyze the data by plotting some graphs like: bar, histogram, pie chart, countplot etc to find the relation between the features and the labels.

Then we added some more features like the studentes grades, percentages, total marks etc so that our model could leran better.
We choose RandomForestRegressor and then predicted our results and in the testing following results werre obtained:
MAE: 2.0979027331241356
MSE: 7.815835254888555
RMSE: 2.79568153674351
R_square score:  0.9666645259110784
